## 𝒲𝒽ℴ 𝒾𝓈 𝒾𝓉 𝒻ℴ𝓇?
  -This program is useful to everyone and especially to those who have nothing to do on a bright sunny day. It can really be helpful if your mind is blank out of ideas on what to do or if you're unable to decide what you want and just need a little help to pick out what activities to do and what snacks to eat!

## 𝒲𝒽𝒶𝓉 𝒹ℴℯ𝓈 𝒾𝓉 𝒹ℴ?
  -This program helps the user build their perfect summer day when they are bored by guiding them through options from a list that they can choose to their liking for different activities and snacks. After the user chooses everything, the program automatically gives them a detailed summary to be sure of what they chose- and also so it makes it easier for them to see what their plan is for the day. This code uses functions, loops, and lists to execute the program correctly and keeps asking for the right input when the user tries to break it.
